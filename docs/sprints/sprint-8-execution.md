# Sprint 8 Execution Log — Learning Experience

## Goal

Improve the actual learning experience after the dashboard foundation is in place.

Sprint 8 should make ShinGiTai Language feel more like a guided learning product inside lessons, practice, review, and speaking flows — without broad rewrites or premature backend complexity.

## Guardrails

- Work only in the ShinGiTai Language repository.
- Do not touch Forge, ShinGiTai OpenAI, Hub, or unrelated repositories.
- One coherent objective per implementation pass.
- Prefer UI and copy improvements before backend changes.
- Reuse existing routes, data, and components where possible.
- Avoid schema, auth, dependency, or routing changes unless the sprint item explicitly requires them.
- Keep the app buildable after every change.

## Current Sprint Order

### 8.1.1 — AI Teacher Entry UX

Status: Completed in implementation pass.

Scope:
- Improve the empty entry state for the AI Teacher area.
- Help users understand what the AI Teacher does before they start or select a lesson.
- Keep the change limited to the existing teacher index route.
- Avoid backend, schema, auth, dependency, and conversation-flow changes.

Implemented:
- Reworked `src/routes/_authenticated/teacher.index.tsx` into a stronger entry panel.
- Added a clear `AI Teacher` label and `Start a guided language lesson` headline.
- Added three compact benefit cards: structured lesson, active exercises, and voice support.
- Kept avatar selection available in the entry state.
- Updated the start hint from a generic lesson selector message to `Use New lesson to begin`.
- No Supabase query, server function, route destination, auth, dependency, schema, or cross-repository changes were made.

Acceptance:
- AI Teacher entry screen explains the lesson value before the user starts.
- Users can see what to expect from a lesson at a glance.
- Existing lesson creation, lesson selection, avatar picker, and conversation behavior remain unchanged.
- The change stays frontend-only and bounded to the entry experience.

Recommended local checks:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run build
```

### 8.1.2 — New Lesson Dialog Guidance

Status: Completed in implementation pass.

Scope:
- Improve the new lesson dialog so users know what language and level to choose.

- Added level-specific helper copy for A1 through C2.
- Added a loading placeholder for languages while active languages are being fetched.
- Disabled the language selector and start button when active languages are still loading or unavailable.

### 8.1.3 — Teacher Lesson Session Header

Status: Completed in implementation pass.

Scope:

- Kept the existing avatar picker, voice toggle, message flow, chat transport, and conversation persistence unchanged.

Acceptance:
- Active AI Teacher sessions now show clearer context at the top of the lesson.
- Users can tell whether the lesson is ready, warming up, in progress, or waiting for the teacher response.

## Latest Run Summary

Finished `8.1.7 — Teacher Response Error Recovery Copy` as a bounded chat-error UX update.

Changed files:
- `src/components/tutor-chat.tsx`
- `docs/sprints/sprint-8-execution.md`

Implementation notes:
- AI Teacher now shows a structured recovery panel when a response fails.
- Error copy gives the learner practical next steps instead of a dead-end generic message.
- The update is frontend-only and does not change AI behavior, persistence, routes, schema, auth, dependencies, or any non-Language repository.

Local validation still required because this run only used the GitHub connector:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Next Action

Continue Sprint `8.1 — Learning Experience Foundation` with `8.1.8 — Teacher Voice Control Microcopy` using existing chat UI only.
